## üå± A little bit of my story

   When I was 9 years old, I got an Odsey for Christmas, a video game that competed with the Atari, which had a keyboard on its body and a cartridge with text editing software. That was when my passion for technology was born. When I was around 12 years old, my cousins ‚Äã‚Äãgot a TK85 microcomputer that used the TV as a monitor. To motivate us, my aunt bought the Input collection, where we began studying Basic and Assembly programming. Some time later, my uncle brought a cassette recorder from one of his business trips so that we could record programs, since at the time we didn't have hard drives or other storage units. Some time later, the CP500 was released, with a flexible floppy disk drive and a green screen. Inaccessible for my economic reality at the time

I began my professional journey at Data Control, taking a computer course. After a month of the course, when the labs were opened, I dedicated all my free time to it. The course coordinator, Gilson, who happened to be the teacher of my class, asked me two questions: 1. If I would like to work at the company, and 2. If I knew anything about Windows 3.1. I answered, "Not yet, but as soon as I have access to the book, I will learn." So I started working and, given my hunger for learning, I was placed in the doubt center, where I had access to all the books for all the courses that the institution offered. The following week, I was monitoring my own class and answering questions from all the students in the courses in the institution. It was at this time that I began to undertake solving problems through the creation of software.
