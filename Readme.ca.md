### üå± My Story
At age 9, a simple video game ignited my passion for technology.  
By 12, I was programming in BASIC and Assembly on a TK85 microcomputer.  
My first job came soon after a computer course ‚Äî I was quickly invited to work in the same lab where I studied, helping others solve problems through software.  
Since then, I‚Äôve kept learning, building, and improving daily.
